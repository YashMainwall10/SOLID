<------ SOLID PRINCIPLES ------> 

Advantage -> 

i.   Avoid Duplicate Code 
ii.  Easy to Maintain 
iii. Flexible Code 
 

S -> Sinlge Responsibilty Principle 
O -> Open / Closed Principle
L -> Liskov Substitution Principle 
I -> Interface Segmented Principle
D -> Dependency Inversion Principle 


1. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE -> 

A class should have only one reason to change i.e. a class should have only one job . 


class SmartPhone{
    String company ;
    String modelNo ;
    int MRP ;
    SmartPhone(String company , String modelNo , int MRP){
        this.company = company ;
        this.modelNo = modelNo ;
        this.MRP = MRP ;
    }

}

class Bill{
    private SmartPhone smartPhone ;
    private int quantity ;
    public static int billNumber = 0 ;
    private int currentBillNumber ;
    Bill(SmartPhone smartPhone , int quantity){
        this.quantity = quantity ;
        this.smartPhone = smartPhone ;
        this.currentBillNumber = billNumber ;
    }
    public double generateBill(){
        return this.smartPhone.MRP * this.quantity - (0.1 * this.smartPhone.MRP);
    }
    public void saveBillToDB(){
        System.out.println("Saved Bill To DB");
    }
}

Here there are multiple jobs in the Bill class as it is generating bill amount and saving it to the DB as well.

Solution as per Sinlge Responsibilty Principle... ->

class Bill{
    private SmartPhone smartPhone ;
    private int quantity ;
    public static int billNumber = 0 ;
    private int currentBillNumber ;
    Bill(SmartPhone smartPhone , int quantity){
        this.quantity = quantity ;
        this.smartPhone = smartPhone ;
        this.currentBillNumber = billNumber ;
    }
    public double generateBill(){
        return this.smartPhone.MRP * this.quantity - (0.1 * this.smartPhone.MRP);
    }
    
}


class DAO{
    Bill bill ; 
    DAO(Bill bill){
        this.bill = bill ; 
    }
    public void saveBillToDB(){
        System.out.println("Saved Bill To DB");
    }
}

Here there are two classes having different jobs one is to generateBill and Other is to save Bill TO DB . 

2. Open / Closed Principle ...->
Classed should be open for extension but not for modifications.  

class DAO{
    Bill bill ;
    DAO(Bill bill){
        this.bill = bill ;
    }
    public void saveBillToDB(){
        System.out.println("Saved Bill To DB");
    }   
}

Here what we also want to save to add a new method to saveToFile as well ; 
 
class DAO{
    Bill bill ;
    DAO(Bill bill){
        this.bill = bill ;
    }
    public void saveBillToDB(){
        System.out.println("Saved Bill To DB");
    }
    public void saveBillToFile(){
        System.out.println("Save Bill To File");
    }
}

Here we have to modify our DAO class and it also is having two Responsibilties which is not good according 
to our SOLID Principles . 

So we have to extend it in such a way is follows SOLID. 

interface saveBill{
    void saveBill(Bill bill) ;
}

class DataBaseSave implements saveBill{
    @Override
    public void saveBill(Bill bill) {
        System.out.println("Saved Bill To DB");
    }
}

class FileSave implements saveBill{
    @Override
    public void saveBill(Bill bill) {
        System.out.println("Save Bill To File");
    }
}

Here the saveBill interface is open for extension and adding different methods to save.
